#Concatenation Exercise
#I have given you two variables, name and age. Use the format() function to create a sentence that reads:

#Hi my name is Julie and I am 42 years old

#Set that equal to the variable called sentence

name = "Julie"

age = "42"

sentence = format("Hi my name is " + name + " and I am " + age + " years old")

print(sentence)
