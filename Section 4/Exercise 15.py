#And and Or Exercise
#Let's make some code to see if someone can ride a roller coaster. We want the rider to be at least 18 years old or 60+ inches tall.

#Check to see if age is greater than or equal to 18 or height is greater than 60 inches. If so, print:

#Hop on the coaster!

#If not, print:

#You can't ride!
